JaguarProject is an open source C# Habbo server emulator framework with a design motive of being compatible on all systems that support the Mono framework, rather than just Windows.

This project is also aimed towards helping newer coders learn the basics of C# programming, by watching the development in action.

The RaGEZONE development thread for Jaguar is located here: http://forum.ragezone.com/f331/c-open-source-jaguarproject-v18-846980/

Being an open-source project, feel free to contribute ideas on the forum link above.
